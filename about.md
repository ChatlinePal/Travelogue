Mars Hill is the Roman name for a hill in Athens, Greece, called the Hill of Ares or the Areopagus. It is a limestone hill, situated between the Acropolis and the Agora. According to Greek mythology, Ares was the Greek god of war, and this hill was the place where Ares stood trial before the other gods for the murder of Poseidonâ€™s son Alirrothios. Mars Hill served as the meeting place for the Areopagus Court, the highest court in Greece for civil, criminal, and religious matters. Even under Roman rule in the time of the New Testament, Mars Hill remained an important meeting place where philosophy, religion, and law were discussed. It is this legend that gives the hill its various names. 

Another legend says that the hill was the site of the trial of Orestes for killing his stepmother and her lover, Clytemnestra and Aegisthus.
