There were three very important brothers in the ancient Greek god world - Zeus, Hades, and Poseidon. Each of them ruled over some part of the universe. Zeus was the king of all the gods. Hades ran the Underworld. Poseidon was the Lord of the Sea.


## King of all the gods
Mighty Zeus was chosen to rule over all of the gods and all of the earth and all of the heavens. He had many magical powers. He could shape shift and make himself look and sound like anybody. He could throw his lightning bolts and do all kinds of damage. He also had powers that came from being king of all the gods. These were powers of government. 

## Underworld ruler
He had a home high on Mount Olympus, but he is usually live in Underworld, where people go when they died. Hades' job was to run things down in the Underworld. He have a faithful and deeply loved companion, his three-headed dog, Cerberus.

## Lord of the Sea

Poseidon had deep blue eyes and streaming green hair. He was moody and restless and powerful.  Additionally, he is referred to as "Earth-Shaker" due to his role in causing earthquakes, and has been called the "tamer of horses". He is usually depicted as an older male with curly hair and beard. He could magically make an island appear, or a tidal wave cover the shoreline, or send a wave to suck you right off the beach. All it took was a wave of his hand!
