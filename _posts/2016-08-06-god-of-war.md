Ares was the ancient Greek god of war, battlelust, courage and civil order. He was true royalty and one of the Twelve Olympians, and the son of Zeus and Hera. 


Ares was tall, handsome, but also mean and self-centered. He often involved in wars and did not care who won or lost a battle. He just liked bloodshed. His best friend was Eris, the spirit of disagreement. They often brought the spirits of pain, panic, and famine to the world.

## Mars' Hill
Perched on a rocky hill across from the Parthenon, the Areopagus included a high court, temples, and “cultural facilities” (Wikipedia). This high court was the Supreme Court of ancient Athens. Areopagus is Greek for “Ares rock,” after the god of war. Since Ares’ Roman name is Mars, the place is also called “Mars Hill.”.
