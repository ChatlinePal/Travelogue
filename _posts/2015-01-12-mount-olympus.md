When things had to be decided in the mystical world, a council of 12 gods called the Olympians met on Mount Olympus to discuss things. The 12 Olympian gods all kept a home on Mount Olympus. Hades and Poseidon usually stay at their prefered places though. Today, Mount Olympus is  the highest mountain in Greece and it is one of Greece's national parks.
